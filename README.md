# file-i-o

program intentions
this program will serve as a not book for information you want to write down.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
how to use

with this program you can write what ever information you
first you write the name of your file
next  you can put whatever information you want into the file
NOTE: when writing use . for spaces as adding a space causes everything after to be lost for some reason
example: I.am.tay.

That is all enjoy :)
